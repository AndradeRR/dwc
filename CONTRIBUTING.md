## Submitting issues

If you wish to submit concrete recommendations for the Darwin Core Standard that can be assessed, assigned, tracked, and archived, the Issue Tracking System on this site is the mechanism for managing these recommendations.

For any new issue, open the [Issues](http://code.google.com/p/darwincore/issues/list) page (accessible from this page by clicking on the `Issues` tab above. It may be a good idea to review the list of issues to see if the issue you want to report has already been reported. If it has, you may want to add comments to that existing issue. To do so, click on the row containing the issue to open it's detailed view, then click in the `Add a comment and make changes` text box and enter your comments. When you are finished, click on the `Save changes` button on the bottom of the page.

If you do not find an existing issue for what you want to report, click in the [New Issue](http://code.google.com/p/darwincore/issues/entry) link on the first row of controls on the [Issues](http://code.google.com/p/darwincore/issues/list) page. Decide which of the basic types of issues (see the list and specific instructions for these below) best matches the one you want to report and select the appropriate template in the `Template` selection box. A form appropriate to your choice will appear. Fill in the form as completely and clearly as possible following the guidelines given within the template itself. When you have finished filling in the form, click on the `Submit issue` button at the bottom of the page.

There are four types of issues that should be reported using this system. Descriptions of these categories of issues are given below and are directly accessible from the following links:
